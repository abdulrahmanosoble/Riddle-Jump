# Riddle-Jump

This was a project for course "Software Design For Engineers". I worked with Firas Sardast and Mohammed Nur on this project.

The game was created using Java and Arduino. The java program displays riddles with small numbers as the answer. The player must jump the correct number of times to 'input' his/her answer. The arduino uses accelerometers to detect jumps and sends them to through Zigbee to the java program. The player has a time limit to answer all riddles.

Here is a video that demonstrates the project. I am not in the video.
